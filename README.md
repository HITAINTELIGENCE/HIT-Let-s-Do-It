## 💡 Introduction
+ The project is inspired by the needs of the dropshipping T-shirt model. It aims to enable users to upload photos of themselves to virtually try on clothes, making it easier to finalize their purchases when they find a suitable match. 

+ Try-on-clothes is an interactive web app that benefits users by allowing them to see how a particular item fits them. This virtual try-on feature not only enhances the shopping experience and revolutionizes the way people shop for clothes but also reduces costs for retailers.
## 📝 Description

+ The following project is an implementation of paper "VITON: An Image-based Virtual Try-on Network" from University of Maryland, College Park, China. https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08447

## Implementation
+ Pose generation using openpose
+ Human parsing using psp-net
+ Used Generative Adversarial Networks with Adversarial loss, perceptual loss and L1 loss for smoothening.
+ Used U-Net for generator and a downsampler for discriminator.
